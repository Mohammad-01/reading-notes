## What's Javascript Operators
An operator produces a result by performing some action on a single or multiple operands (data value). For example, 1 + 2 is an operator with 1 as the left operand and 2 as the right operand. The + operator adds two numeric numbers, yielding a result of 3, in this case.
## JavaScript categories of operators
1. Logical Operators
2. Arithmetic Operators
3. Conditional Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Comparison Operators


## Examples 
Logical Operators : &&

Arithmetic Operators : 1+1

Conditional Operators : var a = 10, b = 5;

Assignment Operators : *=

Comparison Operators : ===
