### What's Markdown 
Markdown is a web-based text formatting system. You have complete control over how the document appears; bolding or italicizing phrases, inserting photos, and generating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Markdown is mostly simply plain text with a few non-alphabetic characters like # or * tossed in for good measure.

### What's GitHub Pages 
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from a GitHub Enterprise Server repository, optionally builds the files, and publishes a webpage.

### Types of GitHub Pages sites
* Project
* User 
* Organization

Project, user, and organization sites are the three types of GitHub Pages sites. Project sites are associated with a GitHub Enterprise Server-hosted project, such as a JavaScript library or a recipe collection. A GitHub Enterprise Server account is used to link user and corporate sites.
