## What's HTML 
* HTML/Hyber Text Markup Language is the code that organizes a web page's content and structure. Content could be organized using paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or graphics and data tables, for example.Â 
## What's semantics in HTML
* Semantics is a term used in programming to describe the meaning of a piece of code, such as "what purpose or role does that HTML element have?"
Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of information in webpages and web applications rather than simply defining its display or appearance, traditional web browsers, as well as a variety of other user agents, process semantic HTML.
## What's wireframe 
* A wireframe is a low-fidelity representation of a web page that depicts the page's fundamental parts. They aren't interactive, and they don't reveal a lot of detail, but they do generate a minimal design that serves as a guide for the project. It becomes a prototype whenever it starts to become interactive.
