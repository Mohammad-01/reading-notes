## What's Git 
* Git is a piece of software that allows you to track changes in any set of files. It's typically used to coordinate work among programmers who are working on source code together during software development. Speed, data integrity, and support for dispersed, non-linear workflows are among its objectives.
## Why we use Git 
* Git allows a group of individuals to collaborate on the same files. We use it because it's simpler, faster, and easier to use than traditional "centralized" source control systems, and it helps the team deal with the confusion that occurs when numerous individuals are altering the same files.
## What's ACP 
* ACP means ** Address Commit Push **.    
ACP ( Address Commit Push ) is a process that transfers the commits from your local repository to a remote repo, for example when making changes to files and adding new files in the replit site so we have  to use these commands
first command " git add ." then " git commit -m "text" " then " git push origin main " then files transfer to remote repo, These are the commands of ACP that transfaring files.

### Here is an example about transfaring from replit to GitHub by using ACP commands
