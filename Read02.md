## What's Git 
* Git is a piece of software that allows you to track changes in any set of files. It's typically used to coordinate work among programmers who are working on source code together during software development. Speed, data integrity, and support for dispersed, non-linear workflows are among its objectives.
## Why we use Git 
* Git allows a group of individuals to collaborate on the same files. We use it because it's simpler, faster, and easier to use than traditional "centralized" source control systems, and it helps the team deal with the confusion that occurs when numerous individuals are altering the same files.
